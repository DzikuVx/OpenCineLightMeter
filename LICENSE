2. License Grants and Conditions
--------------------------------

2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
non-exclusive license:
(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, modify, display,
    perform, sublicense and distribute the Covered Software made
    available by such Contributor, if any, under Source Code Form; and
(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor, to make, use, sell, sell
    for importation, and otherwise transfer either its Covered Software
    or (at Your election) any Modification of its Covered Software.

2.2. Effective Date

The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Covered Software
become effective on the date such Covered Software is first distributed
under the terms and conditions of this License, unless such Covered
Software was previously distributed under the terms and conditions of
the Original License. If You initiate litigation against any entity
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any
Covered Software directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
licenses granted to You under this License for that Covered Software
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

2.3. No Further Grants After Effective Date

If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) regarding
any Covered Software, then any patent licenses granted to You by such
entity under this License shall terminate retroactively as of the date
You initiated such litigation.

2.4. Grants of Derivatives

If You create or cause to be created a Larger Work, and such Larger Work
explicitly or by clear implication designates portions of Covered
Software as not subject to the terms of this License, then such portions
of Covered Software shall be excluded from the Larger Work. If Covered
Software is made available under this License, the Larger Work may be
made available under other terms, provided that the requirements of
this License are satisfied for the Covered Software.

3. Distribution Obligations
-----------------------------

3.1. Distribution of Source Form

All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at no charge; and
(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or under other terms of Your choice, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is made available under a
Secondary License to which the Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
provision of the Covered Software applies, then any Covered Software
included in the Larger Work shall remain subject to the terms of this
License and be made available under the terms of this License only.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
-----------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation, then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file that is included with all distributions of the
Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by
statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed
for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
---------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counterclaims, or cross-claims) alleging that any Covered Software
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any Contributor for the Covered Software shall terminate.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty
--------------------------

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as-is" basis,
without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is
free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the
Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective
in any respect, You assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair,
or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part
of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this
License except under this disclaimer.

7. Limitation of Liability
---------------------------

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) shall
any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct,
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use
the Covered Software (including but not limited to damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been
advised of the possibility of such damages.

8. Additional Terms
--------------------

8.1. If You represent, warrant, and agree to be bound by any terms,
conditions, representations, or warranties related to Your use of the
Covered Software that differ from the terms, conditions, representations,
and warranties of this License, Your use of the Covered Software is
conditioned upon Your acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, those
additional terms, conditions, representations, and warranties.

8.2. All communications related to this License or Covered Software (except
as allowed by the terms hereof or required by applicable law) shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been delivered when received by a
party (notice shall be effective upon receipt).

9. Versions of the License
---------------------------

9.1. New Versions

Mozilla may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time
to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

9.2. Effect of New Versions

You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms specified in any
version of this License that You indicate You are using (or under the terms
of any later version to which You have agreed, if any).

9.3. Later Versions

If the Covered Software indicates it is available under "or later versions"
of this License, You may choose to use the terms of any later version
published by Mozilla.

10. DISCLAIMER OF FAULTS
------------------------

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
